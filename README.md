‚ö†Ô∏è Java Exception Handling ‚Äì Practice Exercises

üß© About This Repository


This repository contains a collection of exercises focused on mastering exception handling in Java. It explores how to detect, handle, and test exceptions properly, following best practices for building robust and resilient applications.

üìã Topics Covered

  ‚úÖ Built-in Exceptions
  - Triggering common exceptions: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, NullPointerException, ArithmeticException

  - Understanding stack traces and debugging


  ‚úÖ Try-Catch-Finally
  - Wrapping risky code in try-catch blocks

  - Using multiple catch clauses for specific exception types

  - Utilizing finally to ensure cleanup (e.g., closing streams)


  ‚úÖ Custom Exceptions
  - Defining custom exception classes that extend Exception or RuntimeException

  - Throwing and documenting custom exceptions with meaningful messages


  ‚úÖ Throws vs Throw
  - Differentiating between throw (to trigger) and throws (to declare)

  - When and why to propagate exceptions up the call stack


  ‚úÖ Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions
  - Identifying which exceptions must be declared

  - Understanding the pros and cons of checked vs unchecked models


  ‚úÖ Exception Testing with JUnit
  - Using assertThrows() to verify exception behavior

  - Validating error messages and exception types

  - Parameterized tests to confirm exception handling for a range of inputs


  ‚úÖ Best Practices
  - Avoiding exception swallowing

  - Using exceptions to enforce business logic (judiciously)

  - Logging vs rethrowing exceptions


üß™ Learning Goals
- Learn how exceptions work under the hood

- Develop defensive coding strategies

- Gain fluency with Java‚Äôs exception API

- Write tests to cover both expected and edge-case errors

- Prepare for real-world debugging and interview scenarios
