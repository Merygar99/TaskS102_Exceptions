# 🚀 Exceptions Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Exceptions in Java.

This project consists of designing a simple sales management system in Java.

You will create a class called Product with two attributes: name and price, and another class called Sale, which contains a collection of products and a total sale amount.

The Sale class includes a method calculateTotalSale() that throws a custom exception named EmptySaleException if the product collection is empty. The exception displays the message: "To make a sale, you must first add products". If the collection has items, the method calculates and stores the total price.

Additionally, the program must demonstrate how to generate and catch an IndexOutOfBoundsException
