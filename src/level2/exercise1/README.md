# 🚀 Exceptions Exercise

## 🧩 What’s This About?
This repository contains the solution to a programming exercise designed to strengthen my skills in Java development. The project showcases the implementation of core concepts using Java, version control with Git, and project management with IntelliJ IDEA.

## 📚 Exercise Overview
This repository contains one programming exercise focused on Exceptions in Java.

The goal of this project is to create a utility class called Entry that manages user input via the Scanner class in Java, while robustly handling exceptions.

You will implement static methods to read various data types (such as byte, int, float, double, char, String, and yes/no responses) from the keyboard. If the user enters invalid input—for example, an incorrect number format—appropriate error messages should be displayed, and the method will repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is provided.

Input-related exceptions like InputMismatchException and custom exceptions derived from Exception must be handled gracefully. Each method accepts a prompt message and returns the correctly typed value entered by the user.
